> Commits you push to the connected branch sync back to Lovable and show up in

- SSR is disabled app-wide via `defaultSsr: false` in src/start.ts; the app is client-rendered only.
- Excel import runs in a server function (src/lib/buildings.functions.ts), not a Supabase Edge Function, because TanStack Start apps keep server logic in createServerFn.
- SQL migrations are mirrored in supabase/migrations for reference.
